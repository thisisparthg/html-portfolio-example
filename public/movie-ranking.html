    <h1>The Best Web/TV Series According to Parth</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Web/TV Series of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Mr. Robot</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite Series. I love the concept of saving the world and the story of Elliot it just gives a whole new meaning to the show and makes it appear more realistic to the world.</p>
    <h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
    <p>I mean how can you not have Breaking Bad as your show. It's not just my opinion but the whole world's. There's simply nothing like Breaking Bad.</p>
    <h3>Friends</h3>
    <p>I would give anything to delete my memory and rewatch this show.</p>
